# Types of Functions - ETH + AVAX
A smart contract to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix

## DESCRIPTION
This software is a simple contract that was written in Solidity, a programming language that is used to generate smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract serves the following purposes:
1. Tokens may be minted by the contract owner and sent to a specified address
2. 2. Tokens can be burned and transferred by any user.


### Executing program

You may use the online Solidity IDE Remix to execute this application. Visit the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/ to get started.

Click the "+" symbol in the left-hand sidebar to start a new file once you are on the Remix website. Save the file as HelloWorld.sol or another file with the.sol extension. The contract.sol file's code should be copied and pasted into your file:

Select the "Solidity Compiler" tab from the sidebar on the left to begin compiling the code. Click the "Compile" button after ensuring that the "Compiler" option is set to the most recent solidity version (or another compatible version).

Selecting the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab from the left-hand sidebar will allow you to deploy the contract after the code has been built. Choose your contract from select the "Deploy" button from the dropdown menu.

You may communicate with the contract by using the requireInstance, assertInstance, and revertInstance functions once it has been deployed.
